Hey Folks üëã , In this article we will get to learn about components, their basics, and how we can use them in pages. At the end we will be creating our own custom component. But before that, don't forget to check my previous article, which will ease your journey on component creation. In `Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)`, components are the essential building blocks for creating dynamic and customisable web pages. By utilising components, AEM enables teams to deliver tailored, responsive, and scalable digital experiences, reducing development time and increasing operational efficiency.

## What is Component ?

A component is a piece of code written in HTL that allows a feature to be reused several times with varying contents on separate pages. If you don‚Äôt know what HTL is, please read my prior article to learn the basics before beginning to create components.

**Type of Components :**

**1. `Core Components :-`** This is a predefined list of components provided by AEM to be used that ease our development efforts and are recommended by Adobe. Check-out link for the list of components.

**2. `Custom Components :-`** This is a new set of components that is created with some custom HTML and CSS and with additional features required by businesses that are not supported in Core Components. For complex structures, we usually create custom components.

**3. `Extended Components :-`** This is a one-of-a-kind combination of Custom and Core, in which we use some existing Core HTML to suit the custom requirements. Minor HTML/CSS adjustments are made in Core to achieve the same look and feel as the design.

> [!Note]
> I will be using **vscode** as IDE for development so make sure you have few extensions installed for ease of development and deployment in your local instance post saving the files.
> `AEM Sync and vscode AEM Sync`

Before we begin our adventure as developers, please ensure that your instance is running and AEM project deployed on a local instance; if you missed it, please check my previous article.

## Let's get started with creating component :

**Step 1 :-** Go to CRXDE Lite and navigate to `apps/projects/componenets` http://localhost:4502/crx/de/index.jsp#/apps/aemtutorial/components.
All the components that we will create are always present in this folder.

**Step 2 :-** If you wish to keep the components separated between custom and extended, create a folder by right-clicking on the components folder.

> [!Note]
> Make sure whenever you work with AEM CRX naming convention should always be lowercase, `kebab-case` (words separated by hyphens) no special character are allowed.

**Step 3 :-** Right-click on the folder you have created and select node and its type as cq:Component, and give any name for the component and save the changes by **CTRL + S**.

![Component Create](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Ri-xCj76rVN2ZP7pKef9-g.png)

**Step 4 :-** Right Click on the component that you have created and again create a node with type nt:unstructure with name as cq:dialog and save the changes.

![cq:dialog](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*w87z2M8wFwnKkCWY7tzqeQ.png)

> [!Note]
> It should be always same as cq:dialog you cannot change that because this node gives the flexibity to component to get dynamic values of the components.

**Step 5 :-** Create an HTML file for the component where we will be writing all the HTML and HTL. It will be generated by clicking on the component node, selecting the create file option, naming the file with the same name as the component node followed by the .html extension, and saving the changes.

![HTML File](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*kgt-VAgFCeCE3zptC0O-8w.png)

> [!Note]
> Always ensure that the component node name and HTML file name are the identical to component node name; otherwise, the component will function incorrectly when added to a page.

**Step 6 :-** Go to vscode code and scroll to the components folder in ui.apps. With a right click, you will see the option to import from the AEM server. If you are unable to see the import option, please ensure that the VScode extensions listed above, i.e AEM Sync and vscode AEM Sync are installed.
**ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/aemtutorial/components**

**Step 7 :-** You will see all the nodes are imported to VScode in the same directory as the AEM instance.

**Step 8 :-** Go to the HTML file of the component and paste the below code.

```javascript
 <h1>Hello Guyzz this is my first Static Demo Component<h1>
```

**Step 9 :-** Go to the component > cq:dialog > content.xml file and paste the below code. This is optional for now; we will be using these properties in the next article.

```javascript
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0" xmlns:nt="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0" xmlns:granite="http://www.adobe.com/jcr/granite/1.0" xmlns:cq="http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0" xmlns:sling="http://sling.apache.org/jcr/sling/1.0"
    jcr:mixinTypes="[]"
    jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
    jcr:title="Dialog"
    sling:resourceType="cq/gui/components/authoring/dialog">
    <content
        jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        sling:resourceType="granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/container">
        <items
            jcr:mixinTypes="[]"
            jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
            <max-cards
                jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
                sling:resourceType="granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/numberfield"
                fieldLabel="Enter the Number Show "
                name="./numbers"/>
            <description
                jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
                sling:resourceType="granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/textfield"
                fieldLabel="Enter the Description"
                name="./description"/>
        </items>
    </content>
</jcr:root>
```

Here are some important properties that have been introduced to determine the component‚Äôs functionality and the type of data it will accept. Let‚Äôs talk about those:

- **jcr:title :-** To display the name when dialog is opened on page.
- **sling:resourceType :-** It refers to the location from where dialog‚Äôs behavior will be retrieved. Value will vary depending on node type. Refer to this website to learn about all possible values for it.
- **fieldLabel :-** What name or title should be displayed so that the author knows what should be written.
- **fieldDescription :-** Detail description about the value to be authored.
- **name :-** It is a key to which the value entered by the user is mapped in AEM.
- **helpPath :-** To attach any authoring guide for authoring.

**Step 10 :-** Go to component > content.xml where we will be adding details that will help to identify the name and type of the component.

```javascript
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<jcr:root xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0" xmlns:cq="http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0"
    jcr:primaryType="cq:Component"
    jcr:title="Demo Component"
    componentGroup="AEM Tutorial - Content"/>
```

- **componentGroup :-** It helps us to cluster our components as per the page/structure. We can have multiple component groups, but mostly we define the component group with the type of page, i.e. homepage, profile, about us, or common.

**Step 11 :-** Go to the component node, right-click, and select Export to AEM. Refresh the CRX page of AEM and verify all the changes there.

Congratulations ü•≥! We have created our first static component in AEM and deployed it on a local AEM instance. In the next tutorial, we will learn how to add this component to the page, populate the content authored in the component, and apply some styles to it.

Thank you üôè !
