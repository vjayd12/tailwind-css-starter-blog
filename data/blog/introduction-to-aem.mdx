## What is Adobe Experience Manager ?

Before we get started with AEM, let me first discuss `CMS (Content Management System)`. It is a software platform or system that enables users to `create, manage, and edit` digital material on a website without requiring substantial technical skills. It is commonly used to manage websites, blogs, online businesses, and other digital content platforms.It has a user-friendly interface for organising material, which can contain text, photographs, videos, and other media formats. This makes it easier for non-technical individuals (such marketers, editors, or business owners) to publish and maintain content on their websites without relying on engineers. Traditional CMS include `Wordpress, Joomla, Contentful, and Strapi`, among others.

**Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)** is a comprehensive content management system **(CMS)** for building websites, mobile apps, and forms. It helps businesses manage digital content efficiently with features like `personalization, digital asset management (DAM)`, and integration with Adobe‚Äôs marketing tools.

## Key Feature of Adobe Experience Manager

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) stands out from traditional CMS platforms with several advanced features:

**1. Digital Asset Management (DAM)**

Unlike standard CMS platforms that simply handle web content, AEM incorporates a DAM for efficiently storing, managing, and distributing rich media assets such as videos, images, and documents.

**2. AI-Powered Personalization (Adobe Sensei)**

AEM combines Adobe Sensei, an AI-driven technology that automates content categorisation, personalisation, and suggestions based on user behaviour, which most traditional CMS platforms do not offer.

**3. Headless & Hybrid CMS Capabilities**

AEM supports a headless CMS architecture, which allows content to be distributed via APIs to many platforms (web, mobile, IoT, etc.), while simultaneously providing a classic WYSIWYG experience.

**5. Advanced Workflow Automation**

AEM features customisable workflows for content approval, translation, and publication, which reduces manual effort as compared to typical CMS platforms.

**6. Multi-Site & Multi-Language Management**

Using tools such as Live Copy and Language Copy, organisations may manage many websites across different regions and languages from a single platform.

## Native Integrations with Adobe Experience Manager
