I'm a Full Stack Developer with over 5+ years of experience in web development, contributing to the IT industry by building scalable and flexible websites. Over the years, I’ve worked extensively with a range of Adobe products, including Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) and Adobe Commerce, and have developed strong expertise in modern web technologies such as Laravel, React, and Vue.js.

My journey with Adobe technologies has been especially rewarding — I’ve earned an AEM Sites Expert certification from Adobe, recognizing my hands-on skills and deep understanding of the platform.

I've had the opportunity to work across a variety of industries including Banking, E-commerce, and Insurance, delivering performance-oriented and tailored solutions that align with diverse business goals.

Whether it’s developing robust backend systems, designing dynamic front-end interfaces, or integrating complex platforms, I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset and a commitment to clean, maintainable code. I'm passionate about collaboration, continuous learning, and staying current with the latest tech trends.
